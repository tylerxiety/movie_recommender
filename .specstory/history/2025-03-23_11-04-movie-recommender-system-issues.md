Let me look at your movie recommender system to fix the rating functionality issue. First, I'll check the project structure to understand how the system is implemented.

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory • **20** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `.gitignore` |
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📄 `LICENSE` |
| 📄 `requirements.txt` |
| 📄 `README.md` |
| 📁 `__pycache__` |
| 📄 `app.py` |
| 📄 `model.py` |
| 📄 `precompute_embeddings.py` |
| 📁 `models` |
| 📄 `simple_clean.py` |
| 📄 `clean_dataset.py` |
| 📁 `archive` |
| 📄 `.DS_Store` |
| 📁 `.vscode` |
| 📁 `templates` |
| 📁 `static` |
| 📁 `data` |
| 📁 `playground` |
| 📁 `.specstory` |

</details>

Now let's check the main app.py file to understand how the rating system is implemented:

---

Read file: app.py

Let's look at the model.py file to see how the rating system is implemented:

---

Read file: model.py

---

Let's look at the update_rating method and how it's implemented:

---

Read file: model.py

Now, let's check the frontend code to see how ratings are sent to the backend:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory static/js • **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `main.js` |

</details>

---

Read file: static/js/main.js

---

Let's also check the HTML template:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory templates • **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `index.html` |

</details>

---

Read file: templates/index.html

---

Let's check if the data directory exists and what files it contains:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory data • **4** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `my_movie_ratings.csv` |
| 📄 `.DS_Store` |
| 📄 `movies_dataset_48k.csv` |
| 📄 `wiki_movie_plots_34k.csv` |

</details>

---

Let's check the permissions of the my_movie_ratings.csv file:

---

```bash
ls -la data/my_movie_ratings.csv
```

```
(movrecsys_arm) tylerxie@tylerdeMacBook-Air movie_recommender % ls -la data/my_movie_ratings.csv           l
s -la data/my_movie_ratings.csv
-rw-r--r--@ 1 tylerxie  staff  131490 Mar 23 19:02 data/my_movie_ratings.csv
(movrecsys_arm) tylerxie@tylerdeMacBook-Air movie_recommender %
```

Let's inspect the my_movie_ratings.csv file to see its structure:
